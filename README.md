# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python
Implementation of some machine learning algorithms in Python. 
The goal is to code these algorithms from scratch to have a better grasp of how they work. 

Work in progress. Implemented at the moment:
- Deep Learning
    - MLP: Fully connected neural nets

Kudos to @hedstroem for the big brain help.
